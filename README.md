# Collatz Conjecture

The **Collatz Conjecture**, also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, is a mathematical hypothesis about sequences defined as follows:

1. **Start with any positive integer n**.
2. If n is even, divide it by 2.
3. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Repeat the process indefinitely.

## Key Points:

- **Conjecture**: No matter what positive integer you start with, you will eventually reach the number 1.
- **Sequence Example**:
  - Start with 6: 
    - 6 (even) → 3 (odd) → 10 (even) → 5 (odd) → 16 (even) → 8 (even) → 4 (even) → 2 (even) → 1
- **Unproven**: Despite extensive testing for large numbers, the conjecture has not been proven or disproven for all integers.

## Importance:

- The Collatz Conjecture is an example of a simple problem that is easy to understand yet remains unsolved, illustrating the complexity of number theory.

## Summary

The Collatz Conjecture poses a simple iterative process that leads to a profound question about the behavior of numbers, captivating mathematicians for decades.
